5 Frequently Asked Questions
----------------------------

I don't care about realism, I just want some fun Maglevs to play with.
What regions do you recommend?
	I recommend disabling the UK maglevs and the German Low Speed maglevs.
	These regions introduce trains that ran on lines that barely outlived
	the Soviet Union, if at all. And with the speeds being the lowest of
	all maglevs, players might be left wondering what the point of having
	them is, and since they are the first maglevs you get, it might confuse
	new players.

What NewGRFs do you recommend?
	The Vactrains Set https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=82571
		- Provides a lategame alternative to Maglev, for companies that
		  just a tad too much money.
	Maglev Track Set https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=76532
		- Provides separate tracks for the various types of trains, so the
		  Urban maglevs and high speed maglevs don't run on the same tracks.
		- Can also be used to replace stock maglev tracks.
